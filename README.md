Achmed is a tool to remotely make the music PC in De Bolk shut up (and other controls).

## Usage
Deploy the system by cloning the repository to a folder and opening `index.html`. The application only works when the client has a working connection to the internal network of De Bolk, using either the VPN, a cable or Bolknet.

## Architecture
Achmed is a simple single-page Javascript application built on HTML5 and jQuery.
